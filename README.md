# Lab 13

1. Create a tic-tac-toe game for two players using ngrx. The game board is 3x3. Players take turns by clicking on the board cells using the mouse.  
2. Add undo button and implement "undo" functionality. Players can undo any number of turns.
3. Add a save game button and implement a save feature. When the app is loaded, if there is a saved game, it should load the saved state and allow players to resume the game. Use effects for interacting with the backend. Use json-server as a backend.
